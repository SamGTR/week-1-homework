## Description
This project is about refactoring the existing code of the Horiseon Social Services Inc web application.  
Following is the list of issues and their solutions implemented:
- The title in code was generic, which was edited to make it more informative.
- The source code given was missing semantic elements and the layout was bit difficult to follow. Hence, semantic elements were used replacing div elements.
- The header and footer elemets were added for enhanced structure of the code.
- The img elements were missing the alt attributes which were added for improved accessibility.
- The "search engine optimization" section was missing id which was added to enable navigation to main content on clicking the header element.
- The index.html and style.css files were missing comments which were added to make the code easy to understand.
- Some of the selectors in css file had same properties, which were merged to make the code look compact.
- The position of the some selectors was moved up in css file for following the layout of the webpage.
